Hi, my name is Ben Taylor and I study aerospace engineering at Iowa State University.
I hope to learn a little more about the perks of GitHub every day as it is useful in managing my documents for school and work.
Some of my hobbies include tennis, golf, and trying to create the best home theater setup in my apartment.
Thanks for stopping by!
